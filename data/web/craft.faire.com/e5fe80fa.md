# Fine-tuning Llama3 to measure semantic relevance in search

Written by: Quentin Hsu, Wayne Zhang

## Introduction

As a global wholesale marketplace, Faire connects hundreds of thousands of independent brands and retailers all over the world. Within such a large marketplace, search plays a primary role in helping retailers discover and purchase products for their stores. However, search results that return products that are irrelevant to the query can be more than just an annoyance that makes it harder for retailers to find what they’re looking for — it can reduce trust in Faire’s capabilities to connect retailers with relevant brands.

*We see other types of chips that are not “pita chips.”*

As such, improving the relevance of our search algorithm at Faire is important and ongoing work to ensure we live up to our mission of helping our customers succeed. Evaluating the relevance of search results has historically been a manual process that is hard to scale, but recent AI advancements and increased availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) allow us to leverage their strong natural language understanding capabilities to scale out the labeling of semantic search relevance.

In this blog post, we’ll describe our journey in defining semantic relevance, building visibility of relevance in our search ecosystem, and making relevance a critical and actionable dimension to consider in search.

*Note: Unless otherwise specified all metric improvements are in relative terms.*

**Our key learnings include:**

- Fine-tuned open-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance. In our case, the best fine-tuned Llama3–8b model improves search relevance prediction accuracy by 28% compared to the existing fine-tuned GPT model from a leading LLM provider.
- We developed in-house solutions to fine-tune and serve LLMs. This approach considerably lowers training and inference cost compared to external LLM providers. Effective strategies such as quantization, batching, employing a rapid serving framework like DeepSpeed, and horizontal scaling are crucial for achieving high-throughput inference capable of handling tens of millions of predictions daily.
- Prompt engineering alone cannot fully capture semantic search relevance on Faire. LLM fine-tuning is needed for models to understand our definition of relevance.
- Successful application of a fine-tuned LLM still requires clear problem definition, high-quality labeled data, and model iterations similar to a standard machine learning product integration. In our experimentation, the volume, quality, and composition of the labeled data play the most significant role in enhancing model performance.
- In our application, the fine-tuned Llama3–8b model consistently outperforms the fine-tuned Llama2–7b model, with gains ranging from 1.4% to 8%. Additionally, the fine-tuned Llama3–8b model achieves performance on par with the larger Llama2–13b model.

## Defining semantic relevance

### ESCI framework

We need a clear definition for relevance that can be objectively agreed upon amongst different people before we even begin trying to model the problem. We adopt the ESCI breakdown of relevance used in the Amazon KDD Cup 2022 competition for improving product search.

From a high level, we break down relevance into four tiers (quoted from the competition):

**Exact****(E)**: the item is relevant for the query, and satisfies all the query specifications (e.g., water bottle matching all attributes of a query “plastic water bottle 24oz”, such as material and size)**Substitute****(S)**: the item is somewhat relevant: it fails to fulfill some aspects of the query but the item can be used as a functional substitute (e.g., fleece for a “sweater” query)**Complement****(C)**: the item does not fulfill the query, but could be used in combination with an exact item (e.g., track pants for a “running shoe” query)**Irrelevant****(I)**: the item is irrelevant, or it fails to fulfill a central aspect of the query (e.g., pillow for a “kimono” query)

*Examples for each category of ESCI from Faire search results.*

Having multiple tiers of relevance provides flexibility in using the relevance labels based on downstream application needs. For applications like search engine optimization, where accurate product matching is critical, only exact matches can be chosen to ensure high precision. In contrast, applications in retrieval and ranking could focus on removing only irrelevant matches to prioritize broader recall to help users discover related products.

## Measuring for semantic relevance is challenging

Measuring and modeling for semantic relevance is challenging due to the inherent subjectivity of the problem and the lack of ground truth for relevance from user behavior.

### Search queries are often vague and open to interpretation

Search queries are often short and vague, leading to many queries having multiple interpretations that could vary depending on context and retailer. The query “bat” could be searching for products in the shape of the mammal or it could be looking for baseball bats. The likeliness of whether a retailer is searching for one or the other could depend on whether the retailer is a sticker shop vs a sports shop.

We need to develop guidelines to align on these types of edge cases. Models that we use also need to be able to pick up our definitions of what is relevant.

### Relevance lacks ground truth from user behavior

Historical engagements such as clicks, carts, and orders are sparse and it’s difficult to infer what a lack of engagement means since many things are never seen or never engaged with. Engagement also tends to vary depending on search intent, and sometimes occur on irrelevant products that are highly desirable (e.g., high quality product) or personalized to the customer’s interests outside of the current search session. The final purchasing decision is influenced by a blend of semantic relevance, desirability, and personalization.

Being able to model for relevance would allow us to more comprehensively explore query-product pairs that have never been impressed or engaged.

## Our past approaches to measuring semantic relevance

### Human labeling: a monthly relevance snapshot

When we first started measuring relevance at Faire, we worked with a data annotation vendor to label a sample of query-product pairs every month for measuring the relevance of our search system. This gave us both an initial view into the value of having visibility into relevance and allowed us to iterate on the guidelines/definitions for relevance especially for edge cases. We built out several iterations of decision trees to reach > 90% agreement amongst labelers and our quality audits. These labels served as ground truth for our definition of relevance.

Although human labeling was essential at the start, it was expensive and not immediately actionable due to the one month delay between our measurement and available labels. To make our relevance measurements more actionable, we needed to reduce the cost and lag time of our measurements. LLMs have a strong pretrained understanding of natural language and are particularly suitable in learning from our limited amount of labels to robustly predict for relevance.

### Scaling out with GPT: a daily relevance snapshot

We framed the multi-class classification as a text completion problem and fine-tuned a leading large GPT model to agree with the labelers. In the prompt, we concatenated the search query text with product information (including the name and description of the product), the name of the brand offering the product, and the categorical type of product. The model was tasked to complete the text with one of the four ESCI labels to measure the relevance of the search query and the product.

*Framing query-product pair relevance evaluation as a text completion problem.*

We measured performance with Krippendorff’s Alpha, which intuitively is the agreement between our fine-tuned model and the labels for all four relevance categories. The score typically ranged from 0 to 1 where 0 is random, and 1 is complete agreement. Negative scores can exist when the “disagreements are systematic and exceed what can be expected by chance.” Krippendorff suggests: “[I]t is customary to require α ≥ .800. Where tentative conclusions are still acceptable, α ≥ .667 is the lowest conceivable limit.”

This is a challenging metric since it penalizes all category mistakes equally even if some mistakes are not as harmful as others (e.g., predicting “substitute” when it was labeled as “exact” due to user preferences). We also referenced other metrics like F1 Score for exact vs not exact to gauge whether our models were applicable for measurement.

We reached 0.56 Krippendorff’s Alpha and could label ~300k query product pairs per hour at the time we deployed this to production. This allowed us to start measuring relevance on a daily basis from limited samples.

Our fine-tuned GPT solution made our relevance problem more actionable, but the amount of labels we could obtain was still primarily limited by the costs of using the API offered by the LLM provider. As our search system evolved, our use of the relevance labels for analysis and training increased. In particular, we had begun introducing personalized retrieval sources, which increased the variation of query-product pairs being shown to different retailers and made our existing measurement solutions blind to the aggregate effect of personalization on the search ecosystem.

## Increasing performance and reducing costs with Llama

We needed a way to increase the throughput of relevance labeling at a reduced cost and at equal or better performance. We turned to open-source LLMs that have state-of-the-art performances in various benchmarks. These models often come in different sizes, which makes it possible to choose smaller models tailored for specific tasks, potentially yielding improvements in performance, cost, and operational efficiency. Our tests have focused on Meta’s Llama family of models because of its performance and licensing for commercial use.

### Technical approach for fine-tuning Llama

A key hypothesis we had was that despite the nuances of search relevance understanding, it is a specific language understanding problem that may not require a huge model with hundreds of billions of parameters.

Below we highlight some key considerations in our model setup and training:

- Our fine-tuning has been centered around the smaller base models Llama2–7b, Llama2–13b, and Llama3–8b. One benefit of working with these models is that they fit into the memory of an A100 GPU card and are fast to prototype and iterate on.
- We froze the weights from the underlying model and employed Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning using the LoRA adapter. This significantly reduced the amount of trainable parameters, resulting in lower memory usage and far faster training speed. In the fine-tuning, the training only optimized about 4% of the base model’s parameters.
- We batched training samples, padded short sequences with the
*<eos>*token, and only computed the cross-entropy loss for tokens in the completion text. - The model was trained using DeepSpeed on 8 A100 GPUs with data and tensor parallelization.
- To further reduce GPU memory consumption, we used gradient checkpointing which recomputed some nodes. We found this speed and memory tradeoff made the training more stable and less susceptible to OOM issues.

We trained a multitude of models with different model types, training data sizes, hyper-parameters to achieve better performance. Training leveraged existing GPUs procured for general deep learning development. As a result, iteration of all these parameters is also much quicker and does not come at incremental fine-tuning costs.

Specifically, we tested Llama2–7b, Llama2–13b, and Llama3–8b. We also tested three datasets with different sizes: Small (11k), Medium (50k) and Large (250k). Our existing production model was a large GPT model fine-tuned on the Small dataset. New fine-tuned open-source models are trained on the Medium and Large datasets for two epochs, and all models are evaluated on a hold-out dataset of ~5k records for comparison. The largest model Llama2–13b took about five hours to complete training on the Large dataset.

### Performance with Llama3

In short, our best performing model, Llama3–8b trained on the Large dataset, is able to achieve 28% improvement on Krippendorff’s Alpha from our existing production model. Details of the model results are reported in Table 1. Based on these metrics, we note the following:

- We briefly explored prompt engineering and found that basic prompt engineering with zero-shot prediction was not performant in predicting our definition of semantic search relevance. The fine-tuned GPT model has almost 2x accuracy compared to prompt engineering.
- Increasing the size and composition of the labeled dataset is the most important factor in improving the performance. Models fine-tuned on the Large dataset outperform their counterparts on the Small or Medium dataset.
- The performance differences between different base models decreased as we trained with more ground truth data. For example, on the same medium sized dataset, the fine-tuned GPT and Llama2–7b models reach performance parity, while the Llama3–8b model improves the performance by ~8%. Llama3–8b has similar performance to Llama2–13b. Llama3–8b trained on the Large dataset achieved the best performance, although the difference with Llama2–7b is reduced to about 1.4%.

*Table 1 — Performance scores of different models on relevance classification.*

### Self-hosted inference

The selected Llama3–8b model is hosted on our GPU cluster to create batch predictions of relevance for new search sessions. Our initial application is to leverage the model predicted relevance to measure the performance of our search algorithms on all retailer search sessions. This requires high throughput to score tens of millions of product and query pairs daily. Thus, we set up inference to maximize throughput in the following way:

- Quantize the model to 8 bit
- Run batches on a single A100 GPU
- Improve inference speed using DeepSpeed
- Horizontally scale the number of GPU instances

By doing so, we were able to reach 70 million predictions per day using 16 GPUs when we backfilled our labels at scale.

## Conclusion and future ideas

In summary, successful application of fine-tuned LLMs still required clear problem definition, high-quality labeled data, and model iterations similar to a standard machine learning product integration. We defined semantic relevance and developed guidelines to achieve high agreement when labeling for relevance. We then leveraged LLMs to greatly scale out predictions, reducing the lag time of obtaining relevance labels, and making relevance a far more measurable and actionable dimension in our search system. These scaled out predictions unlocked many downstream use cases including offline retrieval analysis, measurement of personalization, measurable contribution of experiments towards relevance, Pareto frontier exploration between engagement and relevance in the ranker, and more.

The current use of relevance is mainly offline. Deploying the model in a real-time setting or distilling information with smaller models will provide opportunities to change the relevance of search results shown to users. This will require a low-cost and low-latency inference solution.

Going forward, we plan on exploring areas where our fine-tuned LLMs have room to improve, such as missing domain context (e.g., understanding of the product lines or style of a brand) and the limitations with text only context information (e.g., no images). We can explore retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to improve missing domain context and are in the process of exploring multimodal LLMs like LLaVA to help parse out the rich image information. As part of the exploration, we also want to use LLMs to explain why they labeled something as relevant or irrelevant. Having a more granular reasoning for relevance can help us understand difficult search cases and potentially use chain of thought to help improve performance.
