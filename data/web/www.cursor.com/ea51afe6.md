# Security

Keeping your source code and developer environment secure is important to us. This page outlines how we approach security for Cursor.

Please submit potential vulnerabilities via email to security-reports@cursor.com. For any other security-related questions, contact us at security@cursor.com.

## Certifications and third-party assessments

A SOC 2 Type II attestation report is available on request at trust.cursor.com.

We commit to at-least-annual penetration testing by reputable third parties. An executive summary of the latest report is also available on request via our trust portal.

## Infrastructure security

Our list of subprocessors is published on our trust portal. Each subprocessor is evaluated under our vendor risk management program and re-reviewed annually. Cursor respects model blocklists and will not send requests to models on a blocklist.

Cursor does not use or maintain any infrastructure in China. We do not use any companies headquartered in China as subprocessors, and to our knowledge none of our subprocessors do either.

Infrastructure access is granted according to the principle of least privilege. We enforce multi-factor authentication, deploy cybersecurity tools, and monitor system logs and activity.

## Client and agent security

We assess upstream security patches based on risk and impact and, where warranted, merge and release immediately.

Our app makes requests to Cursor backend domains to deliver API, indexing, update, and marketplace functionality. If you're behind a corporate proxy, please allowlist these domains.

Best practices for using Cursor agents securely are documented in our developer docs:

**Agent and developer security:**

- Agent security
- LLM safety and controls
- Cloud Agent network security
- Hooks
- Security considerations for MCP
- Data Encryption and CMEK

**Enterprise administration:**

- Enterprise security features
- Privacy and data governance
- Compliance logging
- MDM deployment
- SSO and SCIM

## Securing our own codebase

We use our own products to help secure our codebase, including BugBot and Cloud Agent automations. See our security agents blog post for more information.

## Privacy Mode

Privacy Mode can be enabled in settings or by a team or enterprise admin. When enabled, we implement technical controls and contractual requirements - such as Zero Data Retention (ZDR) terms with our model providers - so that code data is not stored by our model providers or used for training. Privacy Mode is available to anyone (free or Pro) and is enabled by default for members of a team.

## Account deletion

You can delete your account at any time from the Settings dashboard -- see our account deletion guide for instructions.

For additional assistance with account deletion, contact customer support at hi@cursor.com.
